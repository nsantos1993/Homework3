    <li>finish this challenge statement: For the final project I will design a website that will allow others to sign up and talk video game tournaments as well as joining tournaments for certain games to compete with others around the world for a grand prize.</li>
    <li>Define 3 "types" of people that might want to visit your site (ex: music producers looking for talent, teen looking for new music, Sirius radio DJ)</li>
      <ol>
        <li>18-30 Year Old Males: Sometimes the oldest the males are the more interested they would be when it comes to looking into a game website. Younger males would just still be in that set of mind that they just want to play a game instead of searching up ways of the games or stuff to sign up for the game. These ages i have picked are the ones who look up more about video games and like to know more information of how to get add ons in a game or tournament joining for a game. It does not matter how old you get even if you are a 21 to 30 year old father, video games can still be on your mind and may be your life long dream to play and get payed for doing it. The more the males get older they soon put their young sons to get into gaming showing them how fun it could be.</li>
        <li>Competitive Video Gamers: Many young aged kids, grown teenagers and also adults who are into games would be interested in a website that you can sign up for tournaments in. It is hard to be a pro gamer sometimes because sometimes you wont be recognized by the big people whether your a great player or not. When it comes down to competitive gamers they all want a shot for big prizes so they would immediately look up on where to sign up for game tournaments and my website could be that opportunity. One competitive gamer after another will invite their gamers to go into the website and sign up bringing more players in. This would create the biggest tournament sign up website for all competitive gamers to be in. </li>
        <li>20-25 Year Old Woman: Not much young woman are into games as much as males are but the older woman get especially beginning 20s they see how fun it could be to not just be a girl who likes games but also be a pro woman gamer. Woman also like prizes and having a title for having skill in gaming so they would also want to prove their skills in tournaments. It suprises male gamers and will show them what theyre up against in tournaments on the gaming website. Some woman are really good gamers and im pretty sure there are many out there that compete so why not join more gaming tournaments? It is a good thing and it brings more attention to other woman gamers to sign up on this specific gaming tournament website.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>Find three sites that reflect what you'd like to aspire to or emulate.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/ This site for the Overwatch Leauge reflects on me because i want to aspire others other than myself to achieve on being a professional gamer and learning tips from others pro gamers. Also I believe this will also show how good a game like Overwatch can be to make others buy it and play it more if theyre interested in the game a lot. Last I would say if you want to be on a good team for tournaments on a a game like Overwatch you can reach out to those pro gamers maybe for a chance to show them what you got skill wise and maybe get a chance at the tournaments.</li>
        <li>https://gearsofwar.com/en-us/esports One reason this site reflected me was the skill of the gamers in gears of war. If your as fast and good as a player in gears of war you can basically be a one man problem to others who are great skilled gears of war players to. There is more opportunitys than just other game tournaments because certain kinds of tournaments give away a different type of prize sometimes other than money and a trophy.</li>
        <li>https://www.callofduty.com/esports/ Everyone has been a fan of Call of Duty for years so other gamers seeing tournaments for them would make them want to sign up and also meet other great call of duty players. Call of Duty is a franchise that has not died out and makes millions of players around the world want to take a shot at the big gamers around the world as well. Its a fun game to play so why not join the tournament to have more fun playing for more than just a win.</li>
      </ul>
